My personal portfolio website created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Strapi CMS](https://strapi.io/).
You can view this project at my website: [devinsipal.com](https://devinsipal.com)

## Modifying for your own use:
Clone this project as well as the [Strapi instance](https://github.com/dsipal/strapi-cms)
Strapi can be hosted on Render for free and you can use Supabase to host your postgres database.
This project (the frontend) can be hosted for free on Vercel.

Once you have both of these hosted you can either just fill in content and posts on the live Strapi instance or run Strapi in development mode locally to make changes to the schema as needed, the front end should update automatically.
